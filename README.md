### Repository Introduction

**Project Background Intro:** This Kaggle Compete Titanic dataset was colleceted from the famous shipwrecks diaster "The Sinking of the Royal Mail Ship Titanic" happen on April 14-15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, enroute to New York City from Southampton, England. However, after shi ship wrecked, there were not enought lifeboats for all passengers, which resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

**The Challenge Goal:** using known passenger's features to establish predictive model to predict what types of passenger have higher possibility of surivial?

**Tools:** CSV, Python, R, Java8, h2o.ai, Packages and Quoted codes from Dr. Patrick Hall

**Project Description:** 
This project constructed with multiple machine learning algorithms learnt from GWU DNSC 6290 Responsible Machine Learning and previous courses:
 - Logistic Regression from GLM -- R
 - Random Forest Classification Tree -- R
 - XGBoost -- R
 - Elastic Net GLM -- Python + h2o
 - Monotonic GBM - Python + h2o

The main goal of this project is not only making good prediction accuracy on passenger survival possibility of Titanic shipwreck disaster, but also be avaiable to reveal the decision making process and casuality, interpret to both non-technical consumer and highly-skilled data scientist, avoid disparate treatment and disparate impact, and debugother problems hidding in the machine learning procedure. 

**Attention!** When you try to run the R file, please download the csv file "train.csv" and "test" for data import. When you try to run the Python jupyter notebook, please download the CSV files "train_clean.csv" and "test_clean.csv", and folder "rmltk"!
